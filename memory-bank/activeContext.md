# Active Context: Memory Bank Review & Update (2025-04-25)

## Current Focus

- **Task:** Perform a full review and update of the Memory Bank documentation.
- **Action:** Read all core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) and `.clinerules`.
- **Goal:** Ensure documentation is accurate, consistent, and reflects the latest understanding of the project state.

## Key Findings During Review (2025-04-25)

- **Core Documentation:** `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, and `techContext.md` appear accurate and up-to-date with the project's goals and technical foundation.
- **MCP Tool Handling Inconsistency:**
  - `systemPatterns.md` (under Design Considerations) incorrectly stated that adapters throw errors for `sendMCPChat` and place responsibility solely on the consuming application.
  - `activeContext.md` (previous version), `progress.md`, and `.clinerules` correctly noted that the Anthropic adapter has evolved to integrate tool handling directly within `sendChat`/`generateResponse`.
  - **Resolution:** `systemPatterns.md` needs updating to reflect this evolution. `progress.md` needs emphasis on ensuring _consistency_ of this pattern across _all_ adapters.
- **Unified Thinking/Reasoning:** The pattern using `isThinkingCapable`, `budgetTokens`, and `ThinkingBlock` for both Anthropic thinking and OpenRouter reasoning is consistently documented across relevant files (`systemPatterns.md`, `progress.md`, `.clinerules`).
- **Other Areas (Multimodal, OpenAI Endpoint):** Known areas needing attention (inconsistent multimodal support, OpenAI endpoint divergence) are accurately captured in `progress.md` and `systemPatterns.md`.
- **`.clinerules`:** The existing rules accurately capture the main patterns observed. No immediate additions were identified during this review.

## Next Steps

1.  Update `systemPatterns.md` to correct the description of MCP tool handling.
2.  Update `progress.md` to refine the TODOs and Known Issues regarding tool handling consistency across all adapters and update the date.
3.  Confirm completion of the Memory Bank update.

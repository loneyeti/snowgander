# Progress: AI Vendor Abstraction Layer (2025-04-25)

## What Works

- **Core Abstraction:** Factory (`AIVendorFactory`) and Adapter (`AIVendorAdapter`) patterns are fully implemented.
- **Comprehensive Type System:** The `types.ts` file provides a complete set of TypeScript interfaces and types for all aspects of the library:
  - `ContentBlock` union type with multiple specialized block types
  - `AIVendorAdapter` interface definition
  - Configuration types (`VendorConfig`, `ModelConfig`)
  - Message and response formats
  - Tool-related types
- **Factory Pattern:** The `factory.ts` implementation uses a static configuration map and provides a clean interface for adapter instantiation.
- **Content Blocks (Enhanced):** The `ContentBlock[]` system supports not only text but also images (both URL and base64), thinking blocks, tool use, and tool results.
- **Tool Support:** The Anthropic adapter now integrates tool handling directly into its `sendChat` and `generateResponse` methods, formatting MCP tools for the Anthropic API.
- **Capability Flags:** Adapters report their capabilities (`isVisionCapable`, `isImageGenerationCapable`, `isThinkingCapable`) based on the injected `ModelConfig`.
- **Cost Calculation:** Token usage tracking and cost calculation is implemented using `computeResponseCost` utility and returned in `UsageResponse` objects.
- **Vendor Support:** Adapters exist for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, and OpenRouter with consistent factory instantiation.
- **Thinking/Reasoning Blocks:**
  - **Anthropic:** Fully supports thinking mode via `thinkingMode`/`budgetTokens`.
  - **OpenRouter:** Now supports reasoning tokens via the shared `isThinking` flag and `budgetTokens` parameter. Reasoning output is parsed into `ThinkingBlock`.
- **Google Vision Handling:** `GoogleAIAdapter` now fetches images from URLs (`visionUrl`), determines MIME type, base64 encodes, and sends them to the API (using `axios` and `file-type`).

## What's Left to Build / TODOs

- **Tool Implementation Consistency:**
  - **Priority:** Verify and implement consistent, integrated tool handling (within `sendChat`/`generateResponse`) across **all** adapters (OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter) to match the pattern established in the Anthropic adapter.
  - This includes correct mapping of `MCPAvailableTool` definitions to vendor formats and parsing `ToolUseBlock`/`ToolResultBlock` from vendor responses.
- **Enhanced Content Block Mapping:**
  - OpenRouter adapter likely needs improved mapping for complex content blocks (vision, etc.) beyond simple text extraction.
  - Verify Google vision handling works correctly with various image types/URLs and handles potential errors gracefully.
  - Complete review of all adapters for consistent content block handling is needed.
- **Image Generation Support:**
  - Verify and potentially expand image generation support beyond the OpenAI adapter.
- **Refinement & Testing:**
  - Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all adapters and their interactions with the factory pattern.
  - Add integration tests that verify correct handling of complex content types (images, tools, thinking blocks).

## Current Status

- **Solid Foundation:** The core abstraction layer, comprehensive type system, factory pattern, and adapter implementations are fully in place.
- **Memory Bank Updated:** Documentation has been reviewed and updated to reflect the current project state (as of 2025-04-25). Key inconsistency regarding tool handling documentation resolved.
- **Tool Handling Evolution:** The pattern of integrating tool handling directly into `sendChat`/`generateResponse` (as seen in Anthropic) is the target. Consistency across other adapters is the next major implementation step.
- **Unified Thinking/Reasoning:** A consistent pattern using `isThinkingCapable`, `budgetTokens`, and `ThinkingBlock` is established for Anthropic and OpenRouter.
- **Ready for Implementation:** The library is stable, documented, and ready for work on achieving consistent tool handling and multimodal support across all adapters.

## Known Issues / Limitations

- **Tool Handling Inconsistency:** Currently, only the Anthropic adapter fully integrates tool handling within `sendChat`/`generateResponse`. Other adapters (OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter) require implementation to match this pattern for consistency.
- **Inconsistent Multimodal Support:** Handling of image inputs varies across adapters: Google adapter handles URL fetching/processing, OpenAI handles base64/URLs (via `responses.create`), Anthropic's support depends on the model, and OpenRouter's support is likely basic. Requires standardization.
- **Limited Image Generation:** Image generation support may still be limited to the OpenAI adapter.
- **Potential OpenAI Endpoint Divergence:** Use of `client.responses.create` in `OpenAIAdapter` versus `client.chat.completions.create` in `OpenRouterAdapter` may still be a point of divergence worth examining.

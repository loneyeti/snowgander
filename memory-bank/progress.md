# Progress: AI Vendor Abstraction Layer (2025-04-05)

## What Works

- **Core Abstraction:** Factory (`AIVendorFactory`) and Adapter (`AIVendorAdapter`) patterns are fully implemented.
- **Comprehensive Type System:** The `types.ts` file provides a complete set of TypeScript interfaces and types for all aspects of the library:
  - `ContentBlock` union type with multiple specialized block types
  - `AIVendorAdapter` interface definition
  - Configuration types (`VendorConfig`, `ModelConfig`)
  - Message and response formats
  - Tool-related types
- **Factory Pattern:** The `factory.ts` implementation uses a static configuration map and provides a clean interface for adapter instantiation.
- **Content Blocks (Enhanced):** The `ContentBlock[]` system supports not only text but also images (both URL and base64), thinking blocks, tool use, and tool results.
- **Tool Support:** The Anthropic adapter now integrates tool handling directly into its `sendChat` and `generateResponse` methods, formatting MCP tools for the Anthropic API.
- **Capability Flags:** Adapters report their capabilities (`isVisionCapable`, `isImageGenerationCapable`, `isThinkingCapable`) based on the injected `ModelConfig`.
- **Cost Calculation:** Token usage tracking and cost calculation is implemented using `computeResponseCost` utility and returned in `UsageResponse` objects.
- **Vendor Support:** Adapters exist for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, and OpenRouter with consistent factory instantiation.
- **Thinking Blocks:** Anthropic adapter fully supports thinking mode through the `thinkingMode` option.
- **Google Vision Handling:** `GoogleAIAdapter` now fetches images from URLs (`visionUrl`), determines MIME type, base64 encodes, and sends them to the API (using `axios` and `file-type`).

## What's Left to Build / TODOs

- **Tool Implementation Consistency:**
  - The Anthropic adapter has integrated tool handling, but we need to verify consistent implementation across OpenAI, Google, and OpenRouter adapters.
  - OpenAI adapter may still need mapping for tool call outputs (need to verify current state).
  - OpenRouter adapter may need additional work for tool/function calling parameter handling.
- **Enhanced Content Block Mapping:**
  - OpenRouter adapter likely needs improved mapping for complex content blocks (vision, etc.) beyond simple text extraction.
  - Verify Google vision handling works correctly with various image types/URLs and handles potential errors gracefully.
  - Complete review of all adapters for consistent content block handling is needed.
- **Image Generation Support:**
  - Verify and potentially expand image generation support beyond the OpenAI adapter.
- **Refinement & Testing:**
  - Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all adapters and their interactions with the factory pattern.
  - Add integration tests that verify correct handling of complex content types (images, tools, thinking blocks).

## Current Status

- **Solid Foundation:** The core abstraction layer, comprehensive type system, factory pattern, and adapter implementations are fully in place.
- **Memory Bank Updated:** Documentation has been updated to reflect the current project state (as of 2025-04-05).
- **Tool Handling Evolution:** The approach to tool handling appears to have evolved, with at least the Anthropic adapter integrating MCP tool support directly rather than using a separate `sendMCPChat` method.
- **Ready for Consistency Verification:** The next step is to verify that all adapters handle tools, content blocks, and capabilities with a consistent approach.

## Known Issues / Limitations

- **Tool Handling Consistency:** While the Anthropic adapter now integrates tool handling, we need to verify consistent implementation across all adapters.
- **Inconsistent Multimodal Support:** Handling of image inputs likely still varies across adapters: Google adapter now handles URL fetching/processing, OpenAI handles base64/URLs (via `responses.create`), Anthropic may have limited or no vision support depending on model, and OpenRouter's support may be basic/untested.
- **Limited Image Generation:** Image generation support may still be limited to the OpenAI adapter.
- **Potential OpenAI Endpoint Divergence:** Use of `client.responses.create` in `OpenAIAdapter` versus `client.chat.completions.create` in `OpenRouterAdapter` may still be a point of divergence worth examining.
